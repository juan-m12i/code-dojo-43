# Code-Dojo-43

Code for the 43rd London Code Dojo meetup in July 2018, Go Fish! kata. 

Write a simple terminal app to allow two players to play the card game ‘Go Fish!’. The rules are:

* Each player is dealt seven cards;
* Each player takes a turn to ask the other player for all the cards they have of a certain value e.g. ‘give me all your kings’;
* Either: 
  a) the asked player hands over the cards, and the asking player’s turn continues, or 
  b) the asked player has none and says ‘go fish!’, and it becomes their turn;
* When a player has four of a kind (a ‘book’), they lay them face up on the table;
* When all the books are won, the game ends;
* The player with the most books wins.
